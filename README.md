# Billiards Game

This was a group project done for my Computer Graphics course. We built a 8-ball pool game using JavaScript and the tiny-graphics library.

## Contributions
I was reponsible for the following:
* Game logic (game.js, gui.js)
* Game play display + user interface (index.css, index.html)
* Modeling of the pool balls (Billiards_Game class of main-scene.js)

My other group members were responsible for:
* Physics behind collisions
* Modeling of pool table and cue stick
* Camera view matrices
* Game play sounds

## To play the game

Run the executable host.command using your terminal for Mac users. For Windows, run host.bat.

Then open up localhost:8000 on your browser and enjoy!
